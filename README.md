# HSLSCodeTemplates

**Welcome to the University of Pittsburgh HSLS Code Templates, meticulously crafted for the All of Us (AoU) data!** These templates are intended to act as navigational aids to conduct diverse analyses using AoU data. Our goal is to have multiple templates offered in both R and Python to cater to varied analytical preferences and needs. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced analyst, these templates will be designed to streamline your analysis process, providing comprehensive pathways and sample codes to facilitate effective and reliable results.

Currently, our repository features Condition Association and GWAS templates, with plans to extend our collection by the end of fall. We will be introducing two more templates focusing on drug efficacy and drug side effects (R and Python versions).

**To deploy these templates within a workspace in the All of Us Researcher Workbench, follow the given [instructions](https://support.researchallofus.org/hc/en-us/articles/360042684051-Are-external-coding-files-able-to-be-imported-for-analysis-).**

Our hope is that these versatile and user-friendly R and Python code templates serve as catalysts in your analytical exploration of the AoU data, helping you uncover meaningful insights with efficiency and precision. Keep an eye on our GitHub repository for the upcoming additions and enhancements!
